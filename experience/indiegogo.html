				<p>Indiegogo is a rewards-based startup crowdfunding platform, focused on supporting and raising brand
					awareness for entreprenuers primarly in the technology and hardware sector. Every week, there are
					thousands of new campaigns launched and innovative products introduced. My team was given the task
					of looking into specific international crowdfunding markets, and determining how Indiegogo can
					secure these new entreprenuers when expanding abroad.</p>

						<h3>Process</h3>
						<p>In order to be able to develop a feasible and appropriate strategy that to secure new
							entreprenuers in international regions, our team had to begin by researching in-depth the
							specific crowdfunding markets. This allowed us to develop a complete understanding of the
							particular situation facing each country and how these circumstances would impact expansion.
							From there, we were able to conduct some primary research to gain further insight on
							indiviudal company perspectives on crowdfunding. After gathering all of this information,
							my team and I were able to put together a strategy that we believed would help Indiegogo be
							sucessful in their expansion internationally.

							Unfortunately, I am unable to share many of the details publicy, but please feel free to
							reach out with any further questions!</p>

						<h3>Reflections</h3>
						<p>This project really gave me one of the most meaningful experiences I've had thus far. I was
							able to get firsthand experience with so many new skills in various different settings. This
							included client sourcing and communication, effective yet flexible team leadership, and
							creating professional reports and slide decks. Working through the COVID-19 pandemic, I also
							had to adapt to a multitude of different schedules; I had team members all around the globe,
							including Dubai and Thailand! Overall, I was able to gain so much through this project and
							am definitely exteremely proud of how it turned out.</p>

				<h3>Project Overview</h3>
				<p><strong>&nbsp &nbsp My Position:</strong> &nbsp Strategy Consultant
				</p>
				<hr class="myhrline">
				<p><strong>&nbsp &nbsp Team: &nbsp</strong> 2 Project Managers and 5 Strategy
					Consultants (including myself)</p>
				<hr class="myhrline">
				<p><strong>&nbsp &nbsp Duration: &nbsp</strong> September 2019 - December 2019</p>
				<hr class="myhrline">
				<p><strong>&nbsp &nbsp Tools and Skills: &nbsp</strong> Microsoft Office Suite, Market Research, Primary
					Research

				<p>Samsung, a Fortune 500 technology company headquartered in Seoul, has their own platform for app
					developers. Here, developers of
					all stages are able to create and test their apps on Galaxy devices or the Remote Test Lab offered
					on the platform. Once
					finalized, these apps get published onto the Galaxy Store. My team was asked to identify how Samsung
					can grow its user base and create a more coherent experience for develpers, while also examining
					the effectiveness of gamification techniques.</p>

						<h3>Process</h3>
						<p>My team and I began by performing a competitor analysis with large corporations in the field
							to determine the market standards and compare this to what Samsung offered.
							We then analyzed the already existing developer website, and determined
							specific areas for improvement. For further insight, we gathered primary evidence through
							a survey given to students of all different backgrounds. Finally, we analyzed past attempts
							at gamification and its successes in various markets to determine its viability for Samsung
							when attracting new developers.
						</p></br>
						<p>
							Unfortunately, I am unable to give further details publicly, but feel free to contact me
							with any further questions!

						<h3>Reflections</h3>
						<p>This project was the first of my college experience, and I am so grateful for all of the
							wonderful experiences and skills it provided me. I became exposed to the ability to conduct
							legitimate, useful, and in-depth research that was valuable to a client. I also had my first
							attempts at creating engaging and informative slide decks, as I experimented with new
							designs and infographics each week. Being able to visit the Samsung office in San Jose to
							give our final deliverable was such a valuble and unforgettable experience, and I'm
							so happy with how our project turned out!</p>

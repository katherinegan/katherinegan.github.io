                <p>Tous Les Jours is a French-inspired Korean bakery, providing freshly baked breads and pastries every
                    day. In addition to those goods, they are well known for their signature light and fluffy "cloud"
                    cakes, which have the perfect balance of sweetness. During my senior year of high school and
                    through summer, I worked as a staff member where I maintained general store operations and sought
                    to have meaningful interactions with new individuals every day.</p>

                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>Having this role be one of my first real working experiences, I came in relatively unsure of
                            my capabilities. When I started, I already felt behind and inferior to my coworkers who
                            constantly had to show me how everything worked. Yet, I became more comfortable with the job
                            fairly quickly, which helped me transition from being in training to an experienced
                            employee in a short period of time. My favorite part about the job was that it was always
                            exciting; even when I had already worked there for a few months and thought I knew all the
                            ins and outs of the store, there would be instances where I would pick up something new. I
                            also especially loved helping customers pick out and customize cakes for their special
                            events, and really getting to know regulars personally.

                        <h3>Reflections</h3>
                        <p>Tous Les Jours not only offered me skills in areas I never thought I'd have⁠—
                            creating latte art, writing in chocolate, and wrapping bread in milliseconds, to name a few—
                            but also gave me the experience of recognizing individual value and appreciating the efforts
                            of others.
                            Overall, I believe working in customer service has helped me significantly grow in
                            my personal relations with others, as well as built confidence in my own abilities.</p>

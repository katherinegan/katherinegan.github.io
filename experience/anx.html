                <p>AnX Robotica Corporation is an advanced medical device company aimed at providing patient-friendly
                    diagnose to analyze and diagnose medical conditions. This past summer, I worked on image processing
                    for their Magnetically Controlled Capsule Endoscope within their NaviCamâ„¢ System. More specifically,
                    the two main projects consisted of identifying the H value of color sensors taken from the capsule
                    images, and improving the image quality through contrast enhacement.</p>

                        <h3>Experience</h3>
                        <p>Beginning the role with not too much experience with the type of work involved, I definitely
                            had to learn quickly. Getting familiar with the libraries and tools available to me to begin
                            writing python scripts and generate executables were some of the initial skills that I had
                            to pick up on my own. Yet, I feel that I was able to become accustomed to the necessary
                            libraries such as scikit-learn and OpenCV relaively quickly, and was able to put together
                            the first project of identifying the H value of the color sensors in a GI image. After
                            completing this project indiviudally, my team and I began working on the much larger project
                            of image enhancement. The goal was to increase the quality of the GI images captured by the
                            capsule through the training of an AI model. This involved researching different image
                            enhancement algorithms, generating improved training sets, and writing scripts to help
                            facilitate the image gathering process. Seeing the model improve with each new training set
                            by calculating the PSNR and SSIM values of the images kept me extremely engaged and excited
                            throughout the process, always hoping to make it even better.

                        <h3>Reflections</h3>
                        <p>Working at AnX Robotica was an extremely unique and new experience for me, and offered me so
                            many new skills that I believe will greatly assist my future academic and career
                            aspirations. While I did feel overwhelmed at the start, I believe that pushed me to really
                            take initiative on my own and pick up the skills I needed quickly. Overall, I feel that I
                            was able to really grow as both a programmer and an individual learner, and had a great
                            time working on my projects throughout the summer!
